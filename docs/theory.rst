Resonances and Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics
----------------------------------------------
Electronic resonances are metastable electronic states with finite lifetimes embedded in the
ionization/detachment continuum. Common examples include temporary anions formed by
electron attachment, and core-excited and core-ionized states which can undergo Auger decay or similar 
relaxation pathways. These states are not part of the usual :math:`L^2` Hilbert space of
square integrable functions, and instead belong to the continuous spectrum of the electronic Hamiltonian. 
Theoretical description of resonances is generally not possible by means of conventional 
bound-state quantum chemistry methods, and special techniques are required to obtain accurate 
energies and lifetimes.

Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM) techniques provide an attractive approach
that enables adaptation of existing quantum chemistry methodologies to treat metastable electronic
states. In NHQM formalisms, a resonance appears as a single square-integrable
eigenstate of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, associated with a with a complex eigenvalue: 

.. centered:: :math:`E=E_{res}-i\Gamma/2`.
 
The real part of the energy :math:`(E_{res})` is the resonance position. The imaginary part :math:`(\Gamma/2)` 
is the half-width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state [Reinhardt1982]_.

Complex Absorbing Potential
---------------------------
Complex absorbing potentials (CAPs) are imaginary potentials added to the Hamiltonian, and
they are routinely used for evaluation of resonance parameters. In this context, CAPs 
transform a resonance into a single square integrable state, rendering it accessible by 
means of standard bound-state techniques. To this end, the electronic Hamiltonian is 
augmented with an imaginary potential:

.. centered:: :math:`H^{CAP}=H-i\eta W`

where :math:`\eta` is the CAP strength parameter, and W is a real potential which vanishes in the
vicinity of the molecular system and grows with distance.

Since the CAP-augmented Hamiltonian depends on the strength of the CAP, a choice
has to be made on the optimal value of :math:`\eta` that provides best estimates of the resonance
position and width. In a complete one-electron basis, the exact resonance position and
width are obtained in the limit of an infinitesimally weak CAP :math:`(\eta \rightarrow 0^+)`. In practice
when finite basis sets are used, an optimal CAP strength :math:`\eta_{opt}` is found by locating a stationary
point on the eigenvalue trajectory E(:math:`\eta`). A commonly used criterion is 
the minimum of the logarithmic velocity (:math:`|\eta\frac{dE}{d\eta}|\rightarrow min`) [Riss1993]_.


Projected CAP
----------------------------------------
There are multiple strategies for how to incorporate CAPs into an electronic structure calculation. 
The most straightforward implementation is to engage the one-electron CAP term starting at the 
lowest level of theory (e.g. Hartree-Fock). While conceptually simple, this requires 
modification of electronic structure routines to handle the complex objects. 
Additionally, this approach requires a unique calculation for each :math:`\eta` along the 
eigenvalue trajectory, which can become prohibitively expensive for larger systems or 
dynamical simulation. 

An efficient alternative is to treat the CAP as a first order perturbation, considering only a 
small subset of the eigenstates of the real Hamiltonian [Sommerfeld2001]_. In this so called 
subspace projection scheme, the CAP will be introduced in the basis of the reduced subset of states:

.. centered:: :math:`W_{uv}=\langle u | W | v \rangle`

where :math:`u` and :math:`v` are eigenstates of the real Hamiltonian. Since the CAP is a 
one-particle operator, these expressions can easily be evaluated using 
the CAP matrix in atomic orbital basis evaluated separately, the one-electron reduced 
density matrices (:math:`\rho`) for each state, and the set of transition density matrices
(:math:`\gamma`) between each pair of states that are obtained from the bound-state 
calculation.

.. math::

    W_{uv}=
    \begin{Bmatrix}
    Tr\left[W^{AO}\gamma^{uv} \right ] ,& u \neq v \\ 
    Tr\left[W^{AO}\rho^{u} \right ] ,&  u=v
    \end{Bmatrix}
 
Once CAP matrix is evaluated the CAP-augmented Hamiltonian is constructed as follows:

.. centered:: :math:`H^{CAP}=H_0-i\eta W`

where :math:`H_0` is an appropriate zeroth order Hamiltonian obtained from 
the electronic structure calculation, and :math:`W` is the CAP represented in the subspace. 
Diagonalization of this CAP-augmented Hamiltonian
yields :math:`\eta`-dependent eigenvalues that are used to extract 
resonance position and width. Importantly, as only a small number of states in considered 
(typically less than 30), finding the eigenvalues of the CAP-augmented Hamiltonian has negligible cost in 
comparison to the bound-state electronic structure calculation required to get the initial
set of states (u,v,..). Thus, although this perturbative or projected approach introduces 
another parameter (number of eigenstates), the overall cost is essentially reduced to that
of a single electronic structure calculation.
 
With the zeroth order Hamiltonian and the CAP matrix, eigenvalue trajectories can be 
generated by means of simple external scripts, and estimates of resonances positions and 
widths can be obtained from analysis of the trajectories.

Continuum Remover CAP
----------------------
One of the major challenges of analyzing eigenvalue trajectories is the appearance of 
of unphysical stationary points. To separate the physical complex energy stabilized points from 
the non physical ones, Moiseyev and coworkers [Moiseyev2009]_ have proposed adding an 
additional artificial real valued potential to the CAP Hamiltonian.

.. centered:: :math:`H^{CAP}=H_0+(\lambda - i\eta) W`

This approach is known as continuum remover-CAP or CR-CAP. The idea behind this CR-CAP is that
the true resonance wave function is insensitive to such a potential due to its bound-like nature, while 
artificial stabilization points corresponding to the scattering states would be significantly 
affected by the additional real valued potential. :math:`\lambda` can be positive or negative, and 
there is usually no need to optimize :math:`\lambda`, as it is only used for the purpose of 
identifying the true resonance stabilization point.
