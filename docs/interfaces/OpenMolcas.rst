OpenMolcas
===========

OpenMolcas_ is an open-source quantum chemistry package which specializes 
in multiconfigurational approaches to electronic structure. OpenMolcas can be used in tandem 
with PyOpenCAP to perform complex absorbing potential (extended)multi-state complete active 
space second order perturbation theory [**CAP/MS-CASPT2**] calculations, which have been 
shown to yield accurate energies and lifetimes for metastable electronic states. 
Here, we outline the steps of performing these calculations using OpenMolcas and PyOpenCAP. 
Some suggested readings are provided at the bottom of the page.


Step 1: Running OpenMolcas calculation
----------------------------------------
To generate the one-particle densities required to construct the CAP matrix, the RASSI 
module must be executed with the TRD1 keyword activated. In a future update, when using XMS-CASPT2, RMS-CASPT2, 
or other variants which utilize rotated CASSCF wave functions, the effective Hamiltonian 
will be rotated into the original CASSCF basis using the rotation matrix provided in the output.
For now, only MS-CASPT2 works as intended. RASSI will save transition density matrices 
between each pair of CASSCF states as well as the one-particle density matrices for 
each state to a file titled $Jobname.rassi.h5.

**Export transition densities with RASSI**

.. code-block:: bash

	 &RASSI
	 TRD1
	 HEFF

**Generate effective Hamiltonian with MS-CASPT2**

The MS-CASPT2 approach is required to generate an appropriate zeroth Hamiltonian for the 
projected CAP method. To activate MS-CASPT2 in OpenMolcas, use the Multistate keyword in the CASPT2 
module.

.. code-block:: bash

	&CASPT2
	Multistate = all
	# or
	Xmultistate = all
	
**Reference energy**

There are multiple strategies for obtaining the reference energy used to define the resonance 
position. For anionic resonances, one such strategy is to add an additional diffuse orbital to the active space in order to
mimic ionization, which obtains the resonance and the ground state of the neutral molecule 
in a single calculation [Kunitsa2017]_. Another strategy is to calculate the ground state of the neutral molecule with CASCI/CASPT2 using the optimized orbitals of the 
anionic state [Phung2020]_.  


Step 2: Importing the data to PyOpenCAP
---------------------------------------

**System object**

To run a PyOpenCAP calculation, the geometry and basis set must be imported into a :class:`~pyopencap.System` 
object. The constructor takes in a Python dictionary as an argument. The relevant
keywords are discussed here, and more information is provided in the :ref:`keywords <keywords>` page.

*Rassi.h5*

The rassi.h5 file which contains the one-particle densities also contains the geometry 
and basis set information. To read in from rassi, "molcas_rassi" must set as the value to
the key "molecule", and the path to the file must be set as the value to the key 
"basis_file". Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

	sys_dict = {"molecule": "molcas_rassi","basis_file": "path/to/rassi.h5"}
	my_system = pyopencap.System(sys_dict)
	
*Molden*

Molden files generated by OpenMolcas contain the geometry and basis set information. 
To read in from molden, "molden" must be set as the value to the key "molecule", and the 
path to the file must be set as the value to the key "basis_file". Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

	sys_dict = {"molecule": "molden","basis_file": "path/to/file.molden"}
	my_system = pyopencap.System(sys_dict)

*Inline(not recommended)*

The molecule and basis set can also be specified manually. The "molecule" keyword must 
be set to "read", and then an additional keyword "geometry:" must
be specified, with a string that contains the geometry in xyz format. The "basis_file" keyword 
must be set to a path to a basis set file formatted in Psi4 style, which can be downloaded from
the MolSSI BSE_. Other optional keyword for this section include "bohr_coordinates" and
cart_bf. Please see the :ref:`keywords <keywords>` section for more details. Up to G-type 
functions are supported.

.. code-block:: python

    sys_dict = {"geometry":    '''N  0  0   1.039
                              N  0  0   -1.039
                              X   0  0   0.0''',
            		"molecule" : "read",
            		"basis_file":"path/to/basis.bas",
            		"cart_bf":"d",
            		"bohr_coordinates:": "true"}
    my_system = pyopencap.System(sys_dict)

**One particle densities/zeroth order Hamiltonian**

The CAP matrix is computed by the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object. The constructor 
requires a :class:`~pyopencap.System`, a dictionary containing the CAP parameters, the number of states,
and finally the string "openmolcas", which denotes the ordering of the atomic orbital basis
set. An example is provided below. Please see the keywords section for more information on
the CAP parameters.
  
.. code-block:: python

    cap_dict = {"cap_type": "box",
            	"cap_x":"2.76",
            	"cap_y":"2.76",
            	"cap_z":"4.88",
            	"Radial_precision": "14",
            	"angular_points": "110"}
    nstates = 10
    pc = pyopencap.CAP(my_system,cap_dict,nstates)

Before we can compute the CAP matrix in the state basis, we must load in the density matrices.
The best way is to use the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function. 
As shown below, we define a dictionary which contains the following keys: "package"(openmolcas), "method" 
(electronic structure method chosen), "rassi_h5"(density matrices), and "molcas_output"(output file containing effective Hamiltonian).
The effective Hamiltonian can be retrieved using the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.get_H` function of the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object. 
Currently, only effective Hamiltonians from MS-CASPT2 calculations can be parsed from an OpenMolcas output file. 

.. code-block:: python
	
    es_dict = { "package": "openmolcas",
           "method" : "ms-caspt2",
           "molcas_output":"path/to/output.out",
           "rassi_h5":"path/to/rassi.h5"}
    pc.read_data(es_dict)
    # save the effective Hamiltonian for later use
    h0 = pc.get_H()


Step 3: Computing the CAP matrix
--------------------------------
Once all of the densities are loaded, the CAP matrix is computed 
using :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_projected_cap`. The matrix can be retrieved using :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.get_projected_cap`.

.. code-block:: python

    pc.compute_projected_cap()
    W_mat=pc.get_projected_cap()
    
*Note:*

When using cartesian d, f, or g-type basis functions, special care must be taken to ensure that the normalization 
conventions match what is used by OpenMolcas. In these cases, :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_ao_cap` 
and then :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.renormalize` or :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.renormalize_cap` 
should be invoked before calling :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_projected_cap`.

.. code-block:: python

    pc.compute_ao_cap()
    pc.renormalize()
    pc.compute_projected_cap()


Step 4: Generate and analyze eigenvalue trajectories
----------------------------------------------------
H0 and W, or the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object can be used to construct a :class:`~pyopencap.CAP.analysis.CAPHamiltonian` object. 

.. code-block:: python

	from pyopencap.analysis import CAPHamiltonian
	CAPH = CAPHamiltonian(H0=H0,W=W_mat)
	# equivalently
	CAPH = CAPHamiltonian(pc=pc)

See the :ref:`analysis <analysis>` section for more details.

Officially supported methods
----------------------------
The following methods have been benchmarked, and the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function is capable of parsing 
output files to obtain the zeroth order Hamiltonian.

* MS-CASPT2
* XMS-CASPT2

Untested (use at your own risk!)
--------------------------------
The following methods are capable of dumping densities using the TRD1 keyword of the RASSI module, 
but have not been benchmarked for any systems, and the zeroth order Hamiltonian cannot be parsed
from the output file using the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function. Use at your own caution, and please contact us if you
find success using any of these methods so we can add official support!

* (QD)DMRG-(PC/SC)NEVPT2
* SS-CASPT2 
* MC-PDFT
