Overview
----------

OpenCAP is currently capable of processing quantum chemistry data in order to perform 'projected' complex absorbing potential calculations on metastable electronic states. These calculations are able to extract resonance position and width at the cost of a single bound-state electronic structure calculation. 

We currently support interfaces with the [OpenMolcas](https://molcas.gitlab.io/OpenMolcas/sphinx/) and [Q-Chem](https://www.q-chem.com/) quantum chemistry packages.

If you have questions or need support, please open an issue on GitHub, or contact us directly at gayverjr@bu.edu.
