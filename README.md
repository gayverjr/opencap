OpenCAP is an open-source application aimed at extending the capabilities of electronic structure packages to describe metastable electronic states. 
We currently support an interface with the [OpenMolcas](https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas) and [Pyscf](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf) packages to 
compute resonance positions and widths using the complex absorbing potential method (CAP). 

Please see the [examples](https://github.com/gayverjr/opencap/tree/master/examples) directory or the [tutorial](https://gayverjropencap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) to help get you started on using the software.

For questions or support, please open an issue on GitHub, or contact us directly at gayverjr@bu.edu.

# Documentation
Our documentation is currently under construction. We have separate documentation for the 
command line version (which is aimed more at developers) and the Python API (which is aimed 
more at users).

* Doxygen Documentation for C++ code: https://gayverjr.github.io/opencap/

* Readthedocs Documentation for Python API: https://gayverjropencap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# Installation

## PyOpenCAP (Python module) 

### Install with pip (recommended)

    pip install pyopencap
    # or
    pip3 install pyopencap

Precompiled Python wheels are available on Pypi for almost all Linux systems, and 
most MacOS systems, for Python versions 3.6 and later. 

### Build from source

Compiling PyOpenCAP from source requires first installing all of our [dependencies](#Dependencies). 

For Linux users, any compiler which fully supports the C++17 standard should work 
(e.g GCC 7.x or later). If you are unsure, try updating to the latest version of your 
compiler.

For Mac users, as of MacOS 10.15 Catalina, the Apple Clang provided by XCode **will not work** due to missing standard 
library features. We suggest installing the latest version of GCC (currently 10.2) 
from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then setting the following 
environment variables before attempting to build from source:

```
# for GCC 10 installed by Homebrew

export CC=gcc-10

export CXX=g++-10
```

If your operating system/Python environment is not covered by any of our pre-built wheels,
the command `pip install pyopencap` will download the tarball from Pypi and try to compile from source.
You can also clone the repository and install a local version:

```
git clone https://github.com/gayverjr/opencap.git

cd opencap

pip install .
```

Compiling from source will take several minutes. To monitor your progress, you can run pip 
with the `--verbose` flag.

### Verify installation

To ensure that the installation was successful, return to your home directory, start a Python shell, and type:

    import pyopencap

See the [examples](https://github.com/gayverjr/opencap/tree/master/examples/pyopencap) directory 
and our [tutorial](https://gayverjropencap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) to help get you started.

## OpenCAP (command line version)
Compiling OpenCAP requires installing all of our [dependencies](#Dependencies). Assuming these 
are all installed in locations visible to CMake, installation can proceed as follows:

### Basic steps
These steps have been tested on MacOS 10.13-10.15, and on Centos7.

First clone the git repo

```

git clone https://github.com/gayverjr/opencap.git

cd opencap/opencap

```

Then generate the Makefile using CMake

```

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ..

```

Once the Makefile is generated, build and install the executable.

```
make

make install

```

### MacOS 

For Mac users on **MacOS 10.14 Mojave** or **MacOS 10.15 Catalina**, the Apple Clang provided by 
XCode is missing some C++17 standard library features, which will cause the CMake step to fail. A drop-in
replacement for the missing std::filesystem can be automatically downloaded and installed by 
passing -DH5PP_DOWNLOAD_METHOD=fetch as an argument to CMake:

    cmake -DH5PP_DOWNLOAD_METHOD=fetch -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ..

For Mac users on **MacOS 10.13 High Sierra** or earlier, the Apple Clang provided by XCode 
**will not work**. We suggest installing the latest version of GCC (currently 10.2) 
from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then setting proper environment 
variables for CMake:

    # for GCC10 installed by Homebrew
    CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ..

### Linux

For Linux users, any compiler which fully supports the C++17 standard should work 
(e.g GCC 7.x or later). If you are unsure, try updating to the latest version of your 
compiler. Depending on your distribution, you may also need to install 
Python3 development libraries e.g. `sudo apt-get install python3.x-dev`.

### Verify installation

To verify your installation, run the tests in the build directory

    make test

To run OpenCAP, specify an input file from the command line

    /path/to/opencap input_file.in 

See the [examples](https://github.com/gayverjr/opencap/tree/master/examples/opencap) directory 
and our [documentation](https://gayverjr.github.io/opencap/input.html) to help get you started.


# Dependencies

Building OpenCAP/PyOpenCAP from source requires working installations of the following:

* C++ compiler with full C++17 language support and standard libraries (**Warning: Default Apple Clang on MacOS is not fully supported**)

* Python3 interpreter and development libraries: version >= 3.6

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/):  version >= 3.12

* [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/): hierarchical data format, version >= 1.10

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/): linear algebra library, version >= 3.3

All of these dependencies are available through standard package managers such as 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), and yum/apt-get on Linux. 

The following packages are automatically built at the CMake step (no action required):

* [Numgrid](https://github.com/dftlibs/numgrid): numerical integration library

* [h5pp](https://github.com/DavidAce/h5pp): C++17 wrapper for HDF5

* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11): C++ Python bindings
